I am a PhD candidate in the Civil and Construction Engineering Department at [Purdue University](https://www.purdue.edu/). I am under the supervision of Professor [Arun Prakash](https://engineering.purdue.edu/~aprakas/index.htm), and working in Computational Solid and Structural Mechanics Laboratory (CSSML).

I studied my undergraduate in the Naval Architecture and Ocean Engineering Department at [Pusan National University](https://www.pusan.ac.kr/eng/Main.do) in South Korea, and I received my master degree at the same university. After that, I worked for Hyundai Heavy Industries in South Korea as a researcher in the dynamics department. 

My research focuses on Computational Mechanics. My research interests include computational solid mechanics, fluid-structure interaction(FSI), and real-time hybrid simulation (RTHS). I have developed in-house finite element (FE) codes using MATLAB for computational solid mechanics and computational fluid dynamics (CFD). Also, CyberMech platform have been developed and written in C++ for RTHS to model numerical substructure, controller, and control plant.  For more detail, please click Research.

Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons.
