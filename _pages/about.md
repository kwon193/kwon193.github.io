I am a PhD candidate in the Civil and Construction Engineering Department at [Purdue University](https://www.purdue.edu/). I am under the supervision of Professor [Arun Prakash](https://engineering.purdue.edu/~aprakas/index.htm), and working in Computational Solid and Structural Mechanics Laboratory (CSSML).

I studied my undergraduate in the Naval Architecture and Ocean Engineering Department at [Pusan National University](https://www.pusan.ac.kr/eng/Main.do) in South Korea, and I received my master degree at the same university. After that, I worked for Hyundai Heavy Industries in South Korea as a researcher in the dynamics department. 

My research focuses on Computational Mechanics. My research interests include computational solid mechanics, fluid-structure interaction(FSI), and real-time hybrid simulation (RTHS). I have developed in-house finite element (FE) codes using MATLAB for computational solid mechanics and computational fluid dynamics (CFD). Also, CyberMech platform have been developed and written in C++ for RTHS to model numerical substructure, controller, and control plant.  For more detail, please click Research.
